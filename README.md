# Advent of Code '22

Learning more Java by playing around, writing readable code and designing efficient and generic solutions. 

### What I learned
- Got very comfortable with lambdas, Java streams and the debugging basics in IntelliJ IDEA
- techniques: memoization, branch pruning
- algorithms: BFS, DFS, iterative deepening DFS, Floydâ€™s turtoise and hare cycle detection

### What I feel good about
- Wrote structurally much better and more readable code as the days progressed
- Day 16b [pressure valves and elephants] performance: brought 10m down to 1.2s
- Total combined performance for all problems: 14s

### What I still want to improve
- Day 15b [sensors, beacons]: solve through a parameter check (currently searching line by line)
- Day 19 [resource-collecting robots]: model and solve as a linear optimization problem (currently solved by brute-force)
- Day 20 [decrypted coordinates]: consider using a circular linked list (currently using a linked list and modulos)
- Day 22 [monkey cube]: make solution generic for cube maps of any shape or size (currently solved for a hardcoded cube)

### What I want to do differently next year
- Make my data classes immutable wherever possible
- Learn to use conditional breakpoints for debugging
- Learn to read stack trace when debugging
